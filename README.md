#First Javascript Project after taking a break

##Pros
#####-I was able to manipulate the DOM using javascript and formulate logic rather than hard coding everything
#####-Able to style a simple page without the help of bootstrap or other libraries


##Need Improvements
#####-Need to write more dry code. I wanted t get the funtionality working though. This was my main goal of this project.
#####-Used Google a lot and am unsure if these basics need to come as second nature
